##  Overview

In this classic-inspired arcade-style game, you control the Wolf who must catch falling eggs with a basket. Eggs drop from four directions, and your task is to move the basket left or right to avoid letting any egg hit the ground. Missing an egg causes the game to end. The concept draws inspiration from both the beloved cartoon and an old handheld LCD game of the same theme.  
Understanding the mechanics:
- Catch eggs for points.
- Avoid letting eggs fall.
- Simple, intuitive gameplay rooted in nostalgia.
